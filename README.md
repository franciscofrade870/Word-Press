# Word-Press

In this assignment I would be looking into the different ypes of vulnerabilities for Wordpress version 4.0 using kali linux.
If you look in the the WPScan it showed a scan happening; which resulted 112 vulnerabilites being identified. 2 of those vulnerabilites came from a plugin called reflex gallery; which is used for media. 

## I would upload the list seperate from the gifs so you can see what were identified.
